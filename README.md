# Location to GPX downloader tool
This simple tool will allow you to download the public GPS traces uploaded by Openstreetmap users, so that you can find interesting details about them.\
For me, the most useful aspect is knowing when a path has been traveled for the last time (at least, that is documented).\
Another useful information could be to "follow" a trace, for when you're planning a route but you don't quite know what could be interesting to visit along the way.
